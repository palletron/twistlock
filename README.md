Twistlock
=========
Container management system
---------------------------

The idea of Twistlock is to provide an abstract interface for running
containers and linking them to external services and resources.

Interface
---------
A container interface consists of a control script and a description file.
The control script must implement the following commands:

1. The build command prepares the container for running. It takes no
parameters.
2. The start command runs the container, it reads in a JSON file with
runtime configuration information like the resource mount points.
3. The stop command stops the container.
4. The link command configures the container to connect to given IP endpoints for
services it consumes.

The description file describes the resources that the container provides,
and the resources that the container consumes.

System
------

The Twistlock system listens for JSON-rpc requests given to it over a socket.
It will be capable of the following actions:

1. Add container description. This command makes the service download or receive
a container description and add it to its internal lists of containers it can provision.
2. Build container. This makes the system invoke the build script of a matching
container description.
3. Run container. This makes the system launch the container. This command requires
the parameters specified in the container description file to be specified in the request.
The system will respond with a container identifier for the running container.
4. Stop container. Invokes the stop container script for that container instance.
5. Link container. This configures a container to connect to a service on a given ip address
and port.

Abstraction
------
Twistlock abstracts over container provisioning systems like Docker. The main motivation
for the abstraction is to separate the process of launching and controlling running containers
from the specification and building of the containers. The result should be a small generic
interface that is easy for container management systems to implement and reason with.

The interface should only cover details that are visible to the outside of containers.

Runtime reconfiguration
------
A common situation is that the ip addresses of services change. Ideally the containers can be
updated of these changes without having to be turned off and on again. For lxc containers this
feature is easy enough to implement. 

I am wondering if runtime reconfiguration should be possible for just network links, or for all
variables specified in the description file. For mounts this might be possible, but probably
dangerous, and for environment variables this does not seem to be possible at all.

So for now the conclusion I am going to make is that it is only reasonable for network links,
so I am going to add a link action to the list of actions. If in the future other runtime
configuration options also seem suitable they might get their own actions or if itâ€™s decided
that there are more than one of them they might be grouped in a reconfigure command.
